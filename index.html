        <p>Hi, my name's Matt and I'm a 16 year old Creative Media student from Lincolnshire, UK. I have studied
            Creative Media for 3 years now, and along the way I have produced a range of content from web design to
            photography, and video production to print-based products. On this website you can find examples of work
            I have produced in my time studying the subject. Although my main 'forte' is video production, I have always
            enjoyed photography, and so whenever I am out filming, I'm always sure to take any photo opportunities I can.</p>

        <p>I often upload my work to social media. My main social media platforms are YouTube and Instagram, but links to all social
        media can be found in the page's header.</p>
